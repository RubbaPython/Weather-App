## Introduction
 This is a small training project that I made. Main purpose was to get a grip with APIs, HTML templating and Express.
 
 The app takes your address, converts it into coordinates(longitude and latitude) and uses them to get an accurate weather info.

 + NodeJS **18.12.1**
 + ExpressJS **4.18.2**
 + HBS **4.2.0**

## Setup
 #### To run the application locally:
 
 1. Use ```npm install``` to install all the **NPM** packages

## Status
